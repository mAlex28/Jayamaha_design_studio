      "This modern luxury apartment is located in the town of Havelock City Colombo, Sri Lanka. The owner is a businessman. We all love the idea of luxury. But while there may be a certain style of interior design that evokes the word, isn't true luxury just being able to create the space you want .Just because you can afford those generic luxury attributes like gold fixtures and large kitchens doesn't mean such a design will feel luxurious. there are certainly common indicators of plush design, including lush fabrics and of course, the stunning reflective warmth of gold accents, but there is also a clear emphasis on the importance of comfort, which makes any home a truly luxurious experience. i made sure to create warm and comforting spaces. Everything is handpicked, from the furniture to the color palette, materials and accessories. This apartment has three bedrooms. color fabric for headboard for king size bed.and i designed dressing table and tv cabinet for front of bed and closet.and finally another room for dressing room.customer needed a large space for her clothes. I designed two large closets with a dressing area and added a shoe rack. I think I made a great design for his new apartment.",

      "This house is located in Colombo .The owner is a young businessman. Luxury is not a matter of ownership. It's actually more of a mindset, a philosophy of living the best life available. Size doesn't matter, but style does. Even the smallest studios can dazzle with luxury when high-end interior design is executed well. A high-end interior design should be well executed with an emphasis on quality. At the same time, it should not deviate from the authentic personality of the user. Either as golden details on the furniture or as precious materials and fabrics that we have used to furnish the rooms. We believe that the best approach one should have when creating a home concept is to collaborate with the client and put their needs first. golden details on the furniture, precious materials and fabrics that we used to furnish the rooms. i believe the best approach one should have when creating a home concept is to collaborate with the client and prioritize their needs in furnishing the room, in shades of blue, j included two large sofas for the ground floor and the first floor with square shapes and velvet fabrics. In front is the upholstered bench. In the center of the room is a large rectangular table that seats eight people. The table in question is the Decor table with gold powder coated legs and a decorative marble top. To pair, I chose modern high-backed chairs upholstered in light gray fabric with black and gold legs. And for the courtyard, I chose brick and cement textures for the wall and an antique look for the window. big buddha statue. In fact, I think I did a great job for my client.",

      "In the urban way of life, residential concepts usually focus on the activity of residents. This is the main concept used in this house.This house is located in boalasgamuwa.The owner is a young accountant.They do not require complex spaces, only rooms that will meet their daily needs. The owner also asked to make sure that every room will be used. He should be able to control the functions of the spaces inside the house. Therefore, the house is compact. Attention is directed towards the interior of the building. The house is located in a dense area, so there is no potential of the surroundings to produce a strong architectural concept. As an architectural designer, I decided that the design concept was inside the house itself. Our approach is to remove the borders between the interior and the exterior. The aim is to introduce open spaces on each floor and place them between functional rooms. The courtyard on each floor is an important element of the house. These areas are connected from the ground floor to the top. All materials are made locally. The flooring and finishing of the bathrooms uses local tiles. Glass and wood remain the main material of the house. On the ground floor, more private spaces such as the gym and the guest bedroom are placed. the owner always wants a small garden that suits them to rest and relax. Green spaces also constitute for them a creative and peaceful living environment, so it is arranged in every corner of the house",

      "An outdated bathroom can be one of the most aesthetically displeasing rooms in the home. Unlike a bedroom where a new coat of paint can transform the room in a day, a bathroom remodel could require a plumber, a tile installer, a carpenter, and an electrician as well. Because of the cost and complexity, the bathroom is often low on the list for getting refreshed. An outdated bathroom is not only hard on the eyes though, it also wastes a significant amount of water, uses more energy than necessary, and can give your home less than stellar indoor air quality. There have been incredible innovations in bathroom fixtures since the days of pink toilets, which means a bathroom remodel can drastically reduce your eco-footprint - and reduce your utility bills, as well.",

      "The jet set and the ultra-wealthy are not the only ones interested in luxurious closets. Luxury master closets have gone main stream. Vanity tables/make-u centers, large screen TVs, sofas or other comfortable seating, elaborate lighting designs and more end up in many of today's more opulent closets. A common approach when designing luxurious closets is to enclose all the hanging and shelving sections behind glass doors, using custom led closet lighting systems to highlight the contents of the different closet sections. Shoes, hats, handbags, belts and other clothing or accessories may be used as a striking display worthy of the most upscale department store. Elaborate closet islands with back-lit countertops illuminate the homeowners possessions in splendor, creating a very private atmosphere of sumptuous high-living that goes beyond the closet to permeate every aspect of living in the home.",
